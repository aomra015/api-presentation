# Designing & Building  -- RESTful JSON APIs

This is a sample app I built to accompany the talk I gave at Ottawa's Ruby Meetup. To see the slides and video of the talk please go to [http://www.aomran.com/designing-building-restful-json-apis/](http://www.aomran.com/designing-building-restful-json-apis/)

EasyContacts is simply a contact list so the API should be relatively easy to understand.


### Getting up and running

```
$ git clone git@github.com:aomra015/api-presentation.git
$ bundle install
$ rake db:migrate
$ rake db:seed
```

### Testing it out

There is some sample data so that you can test the API out. If you find a problem please let me know and I'll fix it :)
